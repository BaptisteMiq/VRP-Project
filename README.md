# Trying to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem - Study

![VRP](https://i.imgur.com/fPrtpZE.png)

The goal of our study is to generate an optimized delivery route on a road network that connects multiple cities. This road network is often obstructed by multiple vehicles at different times of the day, so we must be careful to avoid the most troublesome lanes when planning our route. In addition, our fleet of trucks starts from a single point of departure and each truck must return to that point once it has completed its route.

Our study will address the VRP problem. The "Vehicle Routing Problem" is a class of problems whose objective is to determine the paths of a fleet of vehicles in order to deliver a list of customers, to carry out rounds of interventions or visits (Examples: maintenance, repair, controls, medical visits, commercial, ...). The goal of the VRP problem is to optimize and minimize the travel costs of a fleet of vehicles.

We will also perform a statistical study of our solution methods in order to compare their performance such as the quality of the solution, the time taken to identify a solution, and the resources used.
